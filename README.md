# Strava Year of 2022 Recap

Strava removed the yearly recap feature from free accounts, and I think it's a shame that we are now asked to pay a subscription fee to simply view the data we created. So I requested a data dump of my own account activities and decided to make my own "2022 Year in Sports"

## Development

```python
# Start python virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
